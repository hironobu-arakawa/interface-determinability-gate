# Determinability Gate Pattern
#
# Purpose
# -------
# This pattern defines a guardrail for AI-assisted systems based on
# **determinability**, not capability.
#
# If a state cannot be deterministically asserted from an interface
# (UI / HMI / console / API) or certified sensing,
# AI must not infer, assume, or suggest it.
# In such cases, AI is explicitly detached from decision support.
#
# Positioning
# -----------
# - This is NOT VCDesign core.
# - This is a Field-level pattern operating under VCDesign constraints.
# - Its role is to preserve responsibility and interpretation boundaries
#   by preventing implicit physical or causal assumptions.
#
# What this pattern enforces
# --------------------------
# - AI may only reference facts that are determinable without
#   physical assumptions.
# - AI must not perform root-cause inference, causal attribution,
#   or physical reasoning beyond interface-observable facts.
# - When determinability cannot be guaranteed, AI behavior must
#   transition to an explicit "detached" state.
#
# What this pattern does NOT do
# -----------------------------
# - It does not diagnose failures.
# - It does not infer physical, mechanical, or safety-related causes.
# - It does not provide recovery decisions or prescriptions.
# - It does not encode domain-specific knowledge.
#
# Domain neutrality
# -----------------
# This pattern is intentionally domain-agnostic.
# Factory systems, medical devices, infrastructure operations, etc.
# must provide domain vocabulary via profiles or examples,
# not within this core pattern.
#
# Design principle
# ----------------
# "If you cannot deterministically assert it,
#  you must not let AI imagine it."
#
# Silence, when required, is a designed and evaluated outcome.

  intent: 'Allow AI assistance only where facts are determinable from an operational
    interface (e.g., UI/HMI/API) or certified sensors. If not determinable, AI is
    explicitly detached from decision support.

    Domain-specific mappings (e.g., ''CI'', ''HMI'', ''SCADA'') should live in profiles/examples,

definitions:
  determinable_fact:
    description: >
      A fact that can be asserted without physical or causal assumption,
      based solely on interface-observable state or certified signals.

  non_determinable_state:
    description: >
      Any state that requires assumption, interpretation,
      physical inspection, recurrence, or disassembly
      to be asserted.

      - condition_requiring_assumption

  interface_observable_state:
    description: >
      A state explicitly presented by an interface
      as-is, without interpretation.
    examples:
      - enabled_or_disabled
      - displayed_message
      - visible_status_indicator

  certified_signal:
    description: >
      A signal whose semantics are explicitly defined and trusted
      for assertion without interpretation.
    note: >
      Certification is a domain responsibility and
      is defined outside this pattern.

  human_interface_operation_log:
    description: >
      A factual record of human-performed operations
      mediated through an interface.
